Sklearn Future Warnings:
FutureWarning for LogisticRegression
The LogisticRegression algorithm has two recent changes to the default argument values that result in FutureWarning messages.

The first has to do with the solver for finding coefficients and the second has to do with how the model should be used 
to make multi-class classifications. 

Changes to the Solver
The example below will generate a FutureWarning about the solver argument used by LogisticRegression.

# example of LogisticRegression that generates a FutureWarning
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
# prepare dataset
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=100, centers=2, n_features=2)
# create and configure model
model = LogisticRegression()
# fit model
model.fit(X, y)
Running the example results in the following warning message:

FutureWarning: Default solver will be changed to 'lbfgs' in 0.22. Specify a solver to silence this warning.
This issue involves a change from the ‘solver‘ argument that used to default to ‘liblinear‘ and will change to 
default to ‘lbfgs‘ in a future version. You must now specify the ‘solver‘ argument.

To maintain the old behavior, you can specify the argument as follows:

# create and configure model
model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear')

To support the new behavior (recommended), you can specify the argument as follows:

# create and configure model
model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs')

Changes to the Multi-Class
The example below will generate a FutureWarning about the ‘multi_class‘ argument used by LogisticRegression.

# example of LogisticRegression that generates a FutureWarning
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
# prepare dataset
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=100, centers=3, n_features=2)
# create and configure model
model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs')
# fit model
model.fit(X, y)
Running the example results in the following warning message:

FutureWarning: Default multi_class will be changed to 'auto' in 0.22. Specify the multi_class option to silence this warning.
This warning message only affects the use of logistic regression for multi-class classification problems, 
instead of the binary classification problems for which the method was designed.

The default of the ‘multi_class‘ argument is changing from ‘ovr‘ to ‘auto‘.

To maintain the old behavior, you can specify the argument as follows:

# create and configure model
model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs', multi_class='ovr')
To support the new behavior (recommended), you can specify the argument as follows:

# create and configure model
model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs', multi_class='auto')

FutureWarning for SVM
The support vector machine implementation has had a recent change to the ‘gamma‘ argument that results in a warning message,
 specifically the SVC and SVR classes.

The example below will generate a FutureWarning about the ‘gamma‘ argument used by SVC, but just as equally applies to SVR.

# example of SVC that generates a FutureWarning
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.svm import SVC
# prepare dataset
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=100, centers=2, n_features=2)
# create and configure model
model = SVC()
# fit model
model.fit(X, y)
Running this example will generate the following warning message:

FutureWarning: The default value of gamma will change from 'auto' to 'scale' in version 0.22 to account better for 
unscaled features. Set gamma explicitly to 'auto' or 'scale' to avoid this warning.
This warning message reports that the default for the ‘gamma‘ argument is changing from the current value of ‘auto‘ 
to a new default value of ‘scale‘.

The gamma argument only impacts SVM models that use the RBF, Polynomial, or Sigmoid kernel.

The parameter controls the value of the ‘gamma‘ coefficient used in the algorithm and if you do not specify a value, 
a heuristic is used to specify the value. The warning is about a change in the way that the default will be calculated.

To maintain the old behavior, you can specify the argument as follows:


# create and configure model
model = SVC(gamma='auto')
To support the new behavior (recommended), you can specify the argument as follows:


# create and configure model
model = SVC(gamma='scale')

FutureWarning for Decision Tree Ensemble Algorithms
The decision-tree based ensemble algorithms will change the number of sub-models or trees used in the ensemble 
controlled by the ‘n_estimators‘ argument.

This affects models’ random forest and extra trees for classification and regression, specifically the classes: 
RandomForestClassifier, RandomForestRegressor, ExtraTreesClassifier, ExtraTreesRegressor, and RandomTreesEmbedding.

The example below will generate a FutureWarning about the ‘n_estimators‘ argument used by RandomForestClassifier, 
but just as equally applies to RandomForestRegressor and the extra trees classes.

# example of RandomForestClassifier that generates a FutureWarning
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
# prepare dataset
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=100, centers=2, n_features=2)
# create and configure model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
# fit model
model.fit(X, y)



FutureWarning: The default value of n_estimators will change from 10 in version 0.20 to 100 in 0.22.
This warning message reports that the number of submodels is increasing from 10 to 100, likely because 
computers are getting faster and 10 is very small, even 100 is small.

To maintain the old behavior, you can specify the argument as follows:

# create and configure model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)
To support the new behavior (recommended), you can specify the argument as follows:

# create and configure model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
